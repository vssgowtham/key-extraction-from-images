# key-extraction-from-images

Implementation:
Extracting String from image
Input: Image of any size.
Procedure: convert the rgb image to gray image and set the threshold. Resize the image to required dimension and store the binary values of the image based on the threshold.

Extract the key from HMAC sha256 generator and store in a file.

Extract the key from string and HMAC key.
